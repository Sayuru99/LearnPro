### Student Login:

## Technologies and Packages Used

- **Flutter** for building the UI.
- **GetX** for state management and dependency injection.
- **SharedPreferences** for local storage.
- **http** package for API requests.

## Development Notes

- **Reactive State Management:** Encountered challenges with reactive state management and used `GetBuilder` for registration state handling.
- **UI:** The UI is not fully completed at this stage. I plan to create another branch in GitHub to update and enhance the UI after the assignment submission. I kindly request the examiner to review both the main branch and the updated branch to see the latest improvements.

## Issues and Solutions

- **Reactive and Simple State Issues:** Initially faced challenges with reactive and simple state management. Resolved by using GetBuilder for handling registration states.

## Future Improvements

Complete the UI design and functionality enhancements.
